    "This may be bad, but I believe this is the smallest number with more than 500 factors. I believe this because if you look at the factors of the last number, 23284800, then you see that there is no way to take away prime factors from one place and add them to another to produce a lower number with the same number of divisors. Right now the product is $7\\times4\\times3\\times3\\times2$. Reducing any of those numbers would drop the product below 500. So to remove any factor, one must be added somewhere else, but that cannot be done without raising the overall number.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example it is tempting to remove 11 as a factor and reduce the overall number by a lot, but since there is only one 11 factor, removing it cuts the total number of divisors in half, and those divisors must be made up somehow by adding smaller factors with a product less than 11, and there is no way to double the number of divisors while multiplying the final product by less than 11. Adding more existing factors provides diminishing returns in terms of contributing to the total number of divisors."
