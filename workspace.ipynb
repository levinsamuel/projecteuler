    "Firstly, every third Fibonacci number will be even. If the first two are 1 and 2, (odd, even), the next will be odd because odd+even=odd. Then the prior two are (even, odd), so the next one will be odd for the same reason. Then the prior two are odd, so the next will be even because odd+odd=even. Then the prior two are (odd, even), and we can see that the pattern has repeated."

Therefore, at the occurence of each even number, this sequence represents double the sum of the even numbers up to that point (e.g. the sixth number in regular Fibonacci is 8, and the sixth in the above is 20, double the sum of the two even numbers to occur in regular Fibonacci to that point)."

The problem is that this doesn't seem any more computationally efficient than just brute-forcing it.\n",

    "However, as we're calculating $F_2$, then say we obtain term $x_i$ in the sequence. Since the sequence is the cumulative sum of the Fibonacci sequence, then the differece between $x_i$ and $x_{i-1}$ is the value of $y_i$, where $y_i$ is the $i$th term in $F$. This means that as soon as the difference between $x_i$ and $x_{i-1}$ exceeds 4M, we stop.\n",

    "Therefore:\n",
